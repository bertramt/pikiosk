This is a guide and scripts to create a kiosk with a Raspberry Pi.  This can be used with a TV or with the Raspberry Pi touchscreen.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you up and going from a fresh install.  They may need some adaption for your use case.

### Prerequisites

To start you need a Raspberry Pi and an Micro SD card loaded with [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/). I recommend NOOBS Lite for doing a network install.
